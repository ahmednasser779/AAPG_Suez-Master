  Hazards are generally grouped into two broad categories:
</div>
<div id="list">
  <ul>
    <li>
      Safety and Injury Hazards
    </li>
    <li>
      Health and Illnesses Hazards
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div id="content" >
  Health and Illnesses Hazards are very important also as if employees have bad health these will affect work rate.
</div>
<div id="title" >
  Conclusion
</div>
<div id="content" >
  Safety comes first before anything. Injuries result in pain and suffering and may leave a person disabled or handicapped for life. Even minor injuries may cause loss of time from work and lost pay. Insurance benefits are helpful, but compensation payments cannot restore a life, hand, eye or leg. Otherwise damaged machines could be repaired or replaced. Always remember that “safety is no accidents”.
